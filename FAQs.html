				<h1>HOA Information:</h1>
				<h6>Am I a member of the Prairie Fields Homeowners Association?</h6>
				<p>If you own property within the Prairie Fields subdivision, then you are a member of PF HOA.  When you purchased your property in Prairie Fields, you automatically became a member.</p>
				
				<h6>What are the advantages of a Homeowners Association?</h6>
				<p>According to www.planersweb.com, an active HOA helps to ensure a neighborhood will maintain and often enhancing property values.</p>
								
				<h6>Are Homeowners Associations common in central Illinois?</h6>
				<p>Nearly all newer neighborhoods in the area have an HOA to assist in maintaining the grounds and to help maintain the quality of the development over many years.</p>
								
				<h6>What is the history of Prairie Fields Homeowners Association?</h6>
				<p>The HOA started in 1996 by the developer of the subdivision.  From 1996 to 2008, the developer performed and paid for all services.  In 2009, they transitioned to a resident run and funded HOA.</p>

				<h6>What are the HOA Bylaws?</h6>
				<p>The HOA Bylaws can be found <a href="files/PFHOA_ByLaws_Oct2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container2">
				<h1>Getting Involved:</h1>

				<h6>How was the Board of Directors chosen?  Who are they?</h6>
				<p>See the <a href="board.html" target="_blank">board</a> page.</p>
				
				<h6>What committees does the HOA have?  How do I get involved?</h6>
				<p>To volunteer for any committee or attend a committee meeting, email our <a href="mailto:board@prairiefieldshoa.com" target="_blank">board</a>. To volunteer for the Neighborhood Events committee or help with one of our HOA events, email our <a href="mailto:events@prairiefieldshoa.com" target="_blank">events</a>.

			<div class="container2">
				<h1>Dues and Budget:</h1>
				<h6>Why did I receive an invoice?</h6>
				<p>This year, the BOD established an Annual Assessment at $100 for dwelling units.</p>

				<h6>Isn't $100.00 high for an Annual Assessment?</h6>
				<p>Most HOAs of newer neighborhoods in the area charge $100/ yr. $100 is what the BOD determined necessary to cover expenses and have money available for future maintenance needs.</p>

				<h6>What do my dues pay for?</h6>
				<p>The largest expense is the mowing, fertilizing, and weed control.  Also included is insurance, printing, copying, postage, and power bills for the subdivision sign.  Under half of the budget is for capital improvements like repairing storm drain tiles and sidewalks.  You can view the approved budget at the meeting minutes page <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7LDw01_ZSTlY21MX2JKMmRGNUE" target="_blank">here</a>.  ​Monthly statements are available by request to the <a href="mailto:board@prairiefieldshoa.com" target="_blank">board</a>.</p>

				<h6>What capital improvements are planned?</h6>
				<p>Current capital improvements include Prairie Fields signs and replacing a portion of the concrete sidewalk at Indigo and Tomaras.  The BOD will weigh the costs and benefits of improvements to determine if they are necessary and if they can be completed without raising annual dues.</p>

				<h6>How do I get more information about the budget?</h6>
				<p>You can review the approved budget by going <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7LDw01_ZSTlY21MX2JKMmRGNUE" target="_blank">here</a> and clicking on the “financials” link next to the annual meeting date. That page will show the actual budget and descriptions of each.</p>

				<h6>How do I get a dues statement?</h6>
				<p>If you are selling your home and need a closing letter, statement of accounts, or other documents related to HOA dues, email <a href="mailto:accounting@prairiefields.org" target="_blank">accounting@prairiefields.org</a>.</p>

				<h1>Covenants Information:</h1>
				<h6>Are there any rules or regulations which apply to my property?</h6>
				<p>Prairie Fields is regulated by <a href="covenants.html" target="_blank">covenants</a>.   There are different covenants for each <a href="covenants.html" target="_blank">phase</a> of the development. Each set of covenants includes a map, showing the location of the properties that set of covenants applies. Our HOA Bylaws, adopted in 2008, are available <a href="files/PFHOA_ByLaws_Oct2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<h6>How is the HOA going to enforce covenants?</h6>
				<p>Your covenants list  enforcement as the responsibility of a developer related committee.  The Board of Directors is working to change enforcement so that it is controlled by the HOA, and a committee will ultimately establish enforcement procedures.</p>

				<h6>What is covenant consolidation?</h6>
				<p>Because each phase of the subdivision has different covenants, the Board of Directors has a committee evaluating consolidation of the different covenants into one for all homes in PF.  The consolidated covenants would have to be approved by 75% of the residents of each phase of PF.  Email the <a href="mailto:board@prairiefieldshoa.com" target="_blank">board</a> to volunteer for the Covenant Consolidation Committee.</p>

				<h6>Any HOA regulations on Satallites, Antennas, Solar Panels, or Windmills?</h6>
				<p>The HOA doesn't regulate these items based on US Supreme Court laws.  However, the Village of Savoy has restrictions on Solar Panels and Windmills.  Windmills must be positioned so they do not fall onto a neighbor’s property or exceed a certain height.  The FAA regulates airspace within the flight approach to Willard Airport.  Contact <a href="mailto:Dan.Davies@savoy.illinois.gov" target="_blank">Dan Davies</a> at the Village of Savoy for info.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container2">
				<h1>Landscaping:</h1>

				<h6>How does the Board of Directors (BOD) choose who provides services?</h6>
				<p>For large purchases, the BOD solicits a minimum of 3 bids.  The BOD evaluates bids on the basis of best overall value.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="container2">
				<h1>Maintenance:</h1>

				<h6>Do I have to remove snow from the sidewalks?</h6>
				<p>The HOA asks that you keep sidewalks clean and safe, especially for the children walking to school. However, neither the HOA nor the Village of Savoy has any snow removal ordinances.</p>

				<h6>What do I do if a street light is burnt out?</h6>
				<p>The street lights here are owned and maintained by Ameren, but the Village of Savoy “rents” them.  Please contact <a href="mailto:brent.maue@savoy.illinois.gov" target="_blank">Brett Maue</a>, the Public Works Director/Village Engineer, and he will send a maintenance request to Ameren.</p>

				<h6>Do I need permission to plant trees on my property?</h6>
				<p>Only if you wish to plant between the street and sidewalk.  If so, you will need approval from the Village of Savoy Arborist.  The Village, if funds are available, can reimburse the property owner for half of the total cost of purchase and installation for up to $100.00 for each tree installed through the <a href="http://www.savoy.illinois.gov/index.asp?SEC=71F7EDCF-5CF0-4A3C-8AC6-1A90B50DEE65&Type=B_BASIC" target="_blank">Village Right-of-Way Tree Cost Share Program</a>.</p>

				<h1>Parking:</h1>

				<h6>Can I park on the street?</h6>
				<p>Residents are required to park all your vehicles in your garage or driveway according to the covenants. However, visitors are permitted to park on the street.  
				</p>

				<h6>Unattended Vehicles:</h6>
				<p>If a vehicle is left unattended on the street for more than 7 days it may be towed by the Village of Savoy according to ordinance 8.20.070.  Please contact Savoy Building Inspector/Code Enforcement officer, <a href="mailto:Gary.Zinn@savoy.illinois.gov" target="_blank">Gary Zinn</a>, for more information. </p>
