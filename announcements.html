		<h3>Second Annual Holiday Light Contest!</h3>
		<h4>11/15/2016</h4>

				Where: Prairie Fields Neighborhood 
				When: Sunday, December 18th 5:30PM to 7:30PM 
		<br/><br/>
				Planning 
				We will be planning at the next HOA Board meeting at Carrie Busey Elementary on Monday, November 14th at 8pm. If you'd like to help out in any capacity of the planning please attend. 
		<br/><br/>				
				Treat Tables - If you'd like to host, please e-mail <a href="mailto:board@prairiefieldshoa.com" target="_blank">board@prairiefieldshoa.com</a>. 
				We will be looking for folks to provide and monitor the treat tables/voting stations. Each table will be given $30 to purchase the treats. We would like to focus on having these tables stationed at corners throughout the neighborhood to make it easy for visitors to find. This year we are looking to have ballot style voting sheets that people can carry with them as they look at the houses. 
		<br/><br/>				
				PRIZES! 
				As was the case last year, there will be trophies for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place as well as honorable mention ribbons. We will also have a fun prize for one random participating house!

If you have 1-2 hours a month to donate to the neighborhood, you are encouraged to run one of the 3 upcoming vacancies on the Board for a term which begins January 1, 2017 and runs through December 31, 2017.  Applications must be submitted by October 21.

Homeowners must be a member in good standing to vote in the election, and not owe the association more than $10.
